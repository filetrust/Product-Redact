Obfuscate sensitive data from your documents

# The problem

Files often contain sensitive data such as contact details, financial details or other personal data either because users are choosing to place this data in the file for business reasons or because Applications such as Microsoft Office and PDF editors embed metadata.  In a world where files are more widely stored and shared on the web, this data can pose a security risk as well as a financial risk.  Regulations such as EU GDPR or US CCPA allow the imposition of heavy fines for not protecting such personal information and not removing at the request of the subject.

# The Solution
Glasswall Redact can accurately and automatically remove unwanted or sensitive data from documents and replace it with any redaction characters so the data no longer exisits in the file.  It acts on both the visible text in the file and the hidden metadata and can redact both simple text strings and regular expressions such as email addresses, credit card numbers, social or National Insurance numbers or any data with a common text layout.

# How it works
Purchase your license key from the store here.  Define the strings and regular expressions you want to target for redaction.  Submit your files along with the redaction actions list and Glasswall wil lreturn the redacted files to you.
